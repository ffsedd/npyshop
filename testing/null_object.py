"""null.py

This is a sample implementation of the 'Null Object' design pattern.

Roughly, the goal with Null objects is to provide an 'intelligent'
replacement for the often used primitive data type None in Python or
Null (or Null pointers) in other languages. These are used for many
purposes including the important case where one member of some group
of otherwise similar elements is special for whatever reason. Most
often this results in conditional statements to distinguish between
ordinary elements and the primitive Null value.

Among the advantages of using Null objects are the following:

  - Superfluous conditional statements can be avoided
    by providing a first class object alternative for
    the primitive value None.

  - Code readability is improved.

  - Null objects can act as a placeholder for objects
    with behaviour that is not yet implemented.

  - Null objects can be replaced for any other class.

  - Null objects are very predictable at what they do.

To cope with the disadvantage of creating large numbers of passive
objects that do nothing but occupy memory space Null objects are
often combined with the Singleton pattern.

For more information use any internet search engine and look for
combinations of these words: Null, object, design and pattern.

class Null:
    """A class for implementing Null objects.

    This class ignores all parameters passed when constructing or
    calling instances and traps all attribute and method requests.
    Instances of it always (and reliably) do 'nothing'.

    The code might benefit from implementing some further special
    Python methods depending on the context in which its instances
    are used. Especially when comparing and coercing Null objects
    the respective methods' implementation will depend very much
    on the environment and, hence, these special methods are not
    provided here.
