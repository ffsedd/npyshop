# Numpyshop - Image Editor based on Numpy arrays, Matplotlib and Tkinter
--------------------------------------------------------

Adapted from https://github.com/riyasavla/Image-Editor
which uses Pillow library 

Main reason I wrote this was need for simple editor supporting 16bit PNG

 

**All contributions are welcome**
-----------------------------

It is not tested, contains lots of bugs !
I do not have much experience with tkinter and matplotlib :-( 
Code may be inefficient or unnecessary complicated.
